# MedTrack: Smart Medication Reminder and Health Checkup System

## Project Overview

Objective:  
MedTrack is a web-based application that assists users in managing their medication schedule by sending timely reminders, tracking medication adherence, and recommending health checkups based on their health history.

Target Audience:  
Patients who need assistance with medication schedules, individuals with chronic conditions requiring regular checkups, and healthcare providers focused on patient adherence.

## Key Features

1. User Profile and Health Information Collection  
   - Collects users’ medical history, including pre-existing conditions and current medications, as part of the onboarding process.
   - Uses this data to create customized health recommendations and reminders.

2. Medication Reminder and Scheduling System  
   - Users can upload medication reports or manually enter prescriptions, and the system will schedule reminders based on this data.
   - Notifications for each dose are provided, with options for tracking consumption and missed doses.

3. Medication Report Upload and Analysis  
   - Supports both computer-generated (PDF, text) and handwritten (manual entry) medication reports.
   - Computer-generated reports are processed with OCR and NLP to identify medications, dosages, and schedules for automated reminders.

4. Health Checkup Recommendations  
   - Based on the user’s pre-existing conditions, the system recommends regular health checkups.
   - Users are provided with links to health booking platforms to facilitate scheduling.

5. Medication Adherence Feedback  
   - Allows users to mark if they have taken their medication as scheduled or missed a dose.
   - Tracks feedback to monitor adherence and display summaries to users.

## Implementation Plan

The project is divided into several components, with backend and frontend development using open-source and free tools.

### 1. User Profile and Health Data Collection

- Functionality:
  - User registration, login, and profile setup to collect medical details.
  - Collect data about medications and pre-existing conditions.

- Backend Implementation:
  - Flask: REST API endpoints for user data storage and retrieval.
  - Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, medical history, and medication information.

- Frontend Implementation:
  - React: Build registration and profile forms with input validation.
  - UI Library: Use Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for responsive and user-friendly form components.

### 2. Medication Reminder and Scheduling System

- Functionality:
  - Set up automated reminders for scheduled doses based on user prescriptions.
  - Notification alerts for each dose, with options to confirm medication intake.

- Backend Implementation:
  - Flask API: Endpoint `/set-reminder` for setting reminders.
  - Celery + Redis: Schedule background tasks for reminders.
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): Use for browser-based notifications.

- Frontend Implementation:
  - React: Create a dashboard displaying reminders, with “Taken” or “Missed” buttons to track adherence.
  - Firebase Integration: Integrate FCM for real-time notifications.

### 3. Medication Report Upload and Analysis

- Functionality:
  - Allows users to upload computer-generated reports or manually enter prescriptions.
  - Extracts medication details from reports for automated reminders.

- Backend Implementation:
  - Flask API: Endpoint `/upload-report` to accept uploaded files.
  - OCR: Use Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.
  - NLP: Use spaCy or NLTK to parse and identify medication details.

- Frontend Implementation:
  - React: Design a file upload component and form for manual entry.
  - Error Handling: Display feedback on file upload status.

### 4. Health Checkup Recommendations

- Functionality:
  - Provides health checkup recommendations based on medical history.
  - Links to external health booking sites for scheduling checkups.

- Backend Implementation:
  - Database: Store conditions and recommended checkup frequencies.
  - Flask API: Endpoint `/recommend-checkup` to return reminders based on user data.

- Frontend Implementation:
  - React: Display checkup recommendations on the dashboard with booking links.

### 5. Medication Adherence Feedback

- Functionality:
  - Allows users to mark if they took their medication or missed a dose.
  - Feedback is stored and displayed to track adherence.

- Backend Implementation:
  - Flask API: Endpoint `/update-consumption` to record adherence.
  - Database: Track adherence in a `medication_log` table.

- Frontend Implementation:
  - React: Display each scheduled dose with a “Taken” or “Missed” button.
  - Data Visualization: Use Charts.js or D3.js for adherence summaries.

## Development Roadmap

1. Backend Setup: Configure Flask, Celery, and Redis.
2. Frontend UI: Create registration forms, dashboards, and error handling.
3. Reminder System: Implement backend scheduling and FCM integration.
4. File Upload and Analysis: Integrate OCR processing and file handling.
5. Health Recommendations: Provide condition-based checkup reminders.
6. Feedback and Visualization: Implement adherence tracking and progress charts.
